              I'm a senior-year student at the
              <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>,
              where I've spent many years changing paths. I initially majored in
              biology, switched to mathematics, and then finally settled on
              computer science - a diverse field of study with a wonderful blend
              of theory and applications. I spent the first half of my degree
              fascinated by the theoretical side of math and computer science,
              but the ideas eventually became too abstract (and confusing) for
              my tastes. I started to want something more applied in my
              education besides my usual routine of taking notes and doing
              practice problems.
            </p>
            <p class="body-text">
              A major turning point in my interests then came during the
              2020-2021 academic year, which was a new experience in multiple
              ways. School was moved entirely online due to the COVID-19
              pandemic, and my coursework placed a heavy emphasis on large
              programming projects instead of conventional exams. Although I
              already learned how to program using basic data structures and
              algorithms in previous CS courses, it wasn't until the 2020-2021
              academic year that I started to get a sense of all the joys and
              complexities of <em>software engineering</em>. My education that
              year really could be described as "learning by building things".
              This was the idea that the best way to understand a new concept
              was to incorporate it into a programming project. In doing so,
              having to think about things like edge cases, error handling and
              performance optimizations naturally led to a deeper understanding
              that I would never have been able to achieve just by passively
              reading notes. Over the course of that year, I went from knowing
              little of web development to having an appreciation for the
              details of things like asynchronous Javascript, SQL query
              optimization and the TCP protocol - simply because understanding
              these details were crucial for my projects to work. Above all,
              this active style of learning was a lot of fun.
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
              While these projects pushed me to improve my CS fundamentals, the
              most valuable experience that I gained from them was really the
              process of learning to work with other programmers. Since these
              projects were much more complicated than any programming
              assignment I had done before, I was required to work with a fixed
              team of other students for the entire term in order to finish on
              time. Essentially, here's how many of my classes went that year:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Get assigned to a particular project with teammates I've never
                met before at the start of term
              </li>
              <li>
                Become intimidated by the required technologies and the project
                specification
              </li>
              <li>Panic!</li>
              <li>Learn as much as I can from the web and my teammates</li>

              <li>
                Navigate through countless setbacks and successes with my group
                over many weeks
              </li>
              <li>Repeat step 5 for the rest of the term.</li>
              <li>
                Submit the project, with a deeper understanding of myself as a
                learner and teammate
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="body-text">
              A lot of challenges and rewards were involved in this process.
              Having to mull over critical design choices with my team led to
              some nerve-wracking experiences, especially since there often was
              no single “correct” answer - each possible solution had a unique
              set of strengths and weaknesses with particular implications for
              the rest of our project implementation. On the other hand, seeing
              all those weeks of intense collaboration finally pay off in the
              form of a passing test suite at 2 in the morning is a memory that
              I will never forget. It dawned on me that as interesting as my
              previous theoretical classes were, I enjoy programming and
              computer science the most when I’m creating a new product with a
              team. By working together and complementing each others’
              strengths, we gain the ability to create something that would
              normally be far beyond the reach of our individual abilities. Of
              course, this process comes with many challenges. The pressure from
              having limited time and resources, combined with the variability
              of our technical backgrounds, often creates a lot of stress as we
              try to coordinate our actions. Ultimately, however, these
              struggles help me mature as a listener and problem-solver. Every
              discussion with my team is an opportunity for me to learn from
              others about different ways of thinking, each of which can yield
              new subtle insights into the problem at hand. This has given me a
              deep appreciation for the diversity of thought within the
              programming world. I'm always reminded that there is great
              potential in the sense of community that collaboration brings.

            <p class="body-text">
              The 2020-2021 academic year totally changed my career goals. While
              I still admire all the theory I learned earlier in my degree, my
              heart is now oriented towards working in the software engineering
              industry. The projects I've completed have given me a sense of
              fascination for the work done by professional programmers.
              Constructing modern software requires making countless
              considerations for the sake of issues such as reliability,
              security, scalability and maintainability. At the end of the day,
              any industrial codebase completely eclipses my programming
              experience in both sophistication and polish. In order to advance
              my skills closer to that level, I am thus actively seeking
              internship opportunities within software development - in all
              areas of the stack. Admittedly, I sometimes wish I had discovered
              my passion for software engineering earlier in my degree. At the
              same time, however, I've been lucky to even have these
              opportunities in the first place. The world of programming is full
              of fantastic ideas, and I'm excited to join it in the coming years
              ahead.
