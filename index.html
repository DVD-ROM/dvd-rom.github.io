              I'm a senior-year student at the
              <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>,
              where I've spent many years changing paths. I initially studied
              biology, switched to mathematics, and then finally settled on
              computer science - a diverse field of study, with a wonderful
              blend of theory and applications. I spent the first half of my
              degree fascinated by the theoretical side of math and computer
              science, but the ideas eventually became too abstract (and
              confusing) for my tastes. I started to want something more applied
              in my education besides my usual routine of taking notes and doing
              practice problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              A major turning point in my interests then came during the
              2020-2021 academic year, which was a new experience in multiple
              ways. School was moved entirely online due to the COVID-19
              pandemic, and my coursework placed a heavy emphasis on large
              programming projects instead of conventional exams. Although I
              already learned how to program using basic data structures and
              algorithms in previous CS courses, it wasn't until the 2020-2021
              academic year that I started to get a sense of all the joys and
              complexities of <em>software engineering</em>. My education that
              year really could be described as "learning by building things".
              This was the idea that the best way to understand a new concept
              was to incorporate it into a programming project. In doing so,
              having to think about things like edge cases, error handling and
              performance optimizations naturally led to a deeper understanding
              that I would never have been able to achieve just by passively
              reading notes. Over the course of that year, I went from knowing
              little of web development to having an appreciation for the
              details of things like asynchronous Javascript, SQL query
              optimization and the TCP protocol - simply because understanding
              these details were crucial for my projects to work. Above all,
              this active style of learning had a level of fun that I had never
              associated with my studies before - it was the joy of design,
              creation and collaboration all rolled into one.
            </p>

            <p>
              While these projects pushed me to improve my CS fundamentals, the
              most valuable experience that I gained from them was really the
              process of learning to work with other programmers. Since these
              projects were much more complicated than any programming
              assignment I had done before, I was required to work with a fixed
              team of other students for the entire term in order to finish on
              time. Essentially, here's how many of my classes went that year:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Get assigned to a particular project with teammates I've never
                met before at the start of term
              </li>
              <li>
                Become intimidated by the required technologies and the project
                specification
              </li>
              <li>Panic!</li>
              <li>Learn as much as I can from the web and my teammates</li>

              <li>
                Navigate through countless setbacks and successes with my group
                over many weeks
              </li>
              <li>Repeat step 5 for the rest of the term</li>
              <li>
                Submit the project, with a deeper understanding of myself as a
                learner and teammate
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              A lot of challenges and rewards were involved in this process.
              Having to mull over critical design choices with my team led to
              some nerve-wracking experiences, especially since there often was
              no single “correct” answer - each possible solution had a unique
              set of strengths and weaknesses with particular implications for
              the rest of our project implementation. On the other hand, seeing
              all those weeks of intense collaboration finally pay off in the
              form of a passing test suite at 2 in the morning is a memory that
              I will never forget. It dawned on me that, as interesting as my
              previous theoretical classes were, I enjoy programming and
              computer science the most when I’m creating a new product with a
              team. By working together and complementing each others’
              strengths, we gain the ability to create something that would
              normally be far beyond the reach of our abilities as individuals.
              Of course, this process comes with many challenges. The pressure
              from having limited time and resources, combined with the
              variability of our technical backgrounds, often creates a lot of
              stress as we try to coordinate our actions. Ultimately, however,
              these struggles help me mature as a listener and problem-solver.
              Every discussion with my team is an opportunity for me to learn
              from others about different ways of thinking, each of which can
              yield new insights into the problem at hand. This has given me a
              deep appreciation for the diversity of thought within the
              programming world. I'm always reminded that there is great
              potential in the sense of community that collaboration brings.

              The 2020-2021 academic year totally changed my career goals. While
              I still admire all the theory I learned earlier in my degree, my
              heart is now oriented towards working in the software engineering
              industry. The projects I've completed have given me a sense of
              fascination for the work done by professional programmers.
              Constructing modern software requires making endless
              considerations for the sake of issues such as reliability,
              security, scalability and maintainability. At the end of the day,
              the kind of code that is written in industry completely eclipses
              my previous programming work in both sophistication and polish. In
              order to advance my skills closer to that level, I am thus
              actively seeking internship opportunities within software
              development - in all areas of the stack. Although I admittedly
              sometimes wish I had gone into software engineering earlier in my
              degree, I'm ultimately just glad that I had the chance to develop
              this passion in the first place. The world of programming is full
              of fantastic ideas, and I'm excited to continue exploring it in
              the years ahead.

                      To practice server-side development using Python while
                      having some fun, I am currently creating this Django
                      project for the UBC Kung Fu Club. People regularly message
                      the club's Facebook page to inquire about its activities
                      and classes. While some of these inquiries may be
                      complicated enough to require a tailored response from a
                      club executive, many others only need fairly generic
                      replies that don't need to be personalized. This project
                      addresses this generic case by handling the backend logic
                      of a "Frequently" Asked Questions" menu that is shown in
                      the Facebook chat box whenever a user messages the club
                      page. Each option in this menu corresponds to a certain
                      type of inquiry about the club, such as contact
                      information or class types. When the user selects one of
                      these options, the server will instantly respond with
                      appropriate information and media content. This way, the
                      user can learn about opportunities and classes within the
                      club without having to wait for the executive team to
                      check Facebook.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In order to implement this functionality, I had to design
                      my server to conform to the
                      <a
                        href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/reference/send-api/"
                        >Send API</a
                      >, which specifies how the delivery and handling of
                      messages on the Facebook Messenger platform should be
                      automated. Essentially, Facebook triggers the POST
                      endpoint of the server each time the user interacts with
                      the club using Messenger. The server is then responsible
                      for sending the appropriate response to Facebook's API in
                      the correct format so it may be redirected back to the
                      user.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Having to design an application that met Facebook's
                      performance and security standards was a fun exercise that
                      gave me training with a diverse range of backend
                      practices. For example, for every HTTP request sent from
                      Facebook, my server is required to deliver a response
                      within 20 seconds. However, 20 seconds may not be enough
                      time for the server to execute necessary actions in
                      general - for example, large amounts of data may have to
                      be fetched from a third-party API. It was thus important
                      to introduce asynchronity into my Django application,
                      allowing long tasks to be completed in the background and
                      freeing the normal flow of execution to work on other
                      server jobs instead. I learned to accomplish this using
                      Redis Queue as a message broker and Redis as a task queue.
                      Now, for every HTTP request received from Facebook, my
                      server first identifies the kind of club inquiry it
                      represents and then enqueues the appropriate tasks that
                      will formulate the appropriate response. This procedure
                      happens instantaneously, after which my server returns an
                      appropriate HTTP status code to Facebook. This satisfies
                      the 20-second rule, while my server is free to dequeue and
                      execute the tasks when it is not busy. This project also
                      gave me experience with securing my HTTP endpoints. To
                      prevent injection attacks, I verify that Facebook is the
                      sender of each incoming HTTP request by verifying that the
                      SHA1 signature contained in the request's header is the
                      HMAC code generated by the payload using the app secret as
                      a key. This step is strongly recommended by Facebook for
                      all production apps.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Ultimately, the fact that I was developing this
                      application for other people made the work enjoyable and
                      motivating. As a member of the university club that this
                      application is dedicated to, I wanted to make the
                      automated messaging experience as informative and visually
                      appealing as possible in order to showcase how much fun
                      the club is. Therefore, I leveraged a variety of features
                      offered by the Facebook Send API, such as multi-option
                      buttons to receive quick feedback from the Facebook user
                      as well as media templates to show off photos of the
                      club's martial arts. Incorporating both this extended
                      functionality and the basic chatbot flow into an
                      application that could be maintained by the club's
                      executives even without programming experience pushed me

                      I completed this project as part of taking my university's
                      software engineering project course, CPSC 319. Over the
                      12-week semester, I worked with a group of 7 other student
                      developers to design a social web app enabling employees
                      of the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) to
                      reserve desk workspaces, share posts and manage their
                      physical mail. I worked with my team to extract detailed
                      functional requirements from the clients, teach ourselves
                      all required technologies, and implement everything from
                      scratch using our own design. There were no exams or even
                      any "sample code solutions" in the course - my grade was
                      entirely based on the quality of our project deliverables,
                      as judged by the course TAs and the clients. This proved
                      to be one of the most challenging and invaluable
                      experiences in my degree, as my team members and I
                      supported each other to manage the consistent barrage of
                      rapid deadlines and tough bugs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      For our project frontend, I built a visual interface in
                      React that allows ICBC employees to reserve workspaces at
                      their local branch. Upon selecting a date range and a
                      floor number of any company building, users are then able
                      to view an interactive image that renders available desk
                      spaces within the corresponding floor plan as clickable
                      dots. To reserve a particular desk, you select the
                      associated dot to display a popup interface which confirms
                      your request and then indicates if it is successfully
                      made. A lot of React state had to be programmed and
                      debugged to ensure all data within this module stayed
                      consistent with each other. For example, I had to ensure
                      that the floor plan image updated correctly each time the
                      user changed the building location and floor number. In
                      addition, since each dot representing a desk space was
                      colour-coded to indicate availability status, I had to
                      update the module's visuals using newly fetched database
                      content whenever the user placed or canceled a
                      reservation.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      I also worked with our backend team to implement the REST
                      API that enabled our web application to access all of its
                      user data within a remote-hosted MySQL database. Using
                      Spring Boot as a framework, my team and I designed GET,
                      PUT, POST and DELETE endpoints that mapped user actions to
                      the appropriate database operations (eg. see all posts
                      from co-workers, make / remove reservations, edit an
                      existing mail request). In performing these mappings
                      between our database and the frontend, our API also had to
                      correctly handle any necessary data transformations. For
                      example, users of our application are able to create
                      workspace reservations, which are compactly represented in
                      our database as records with a start date and end date
                      attribute. However, our application allows employees with
                      an existing reservation for several consecutive days to
                      cancel the day in the middle, for example. In this case,
                      what is perceived by the user to be a single cancellation
                      operation actually requires our API to perform a couple of
                      steps: the removal of the original multi-day reservation
                      in our database, followed by the addition of two records
                      representing the reservation's components immediately
                      preceding and following the middle cancelled date. This
                      API functionality was a crucial architectural decision
                      that my backend team and I made to address the differing
                      data schemas of our frontend and database.

                      As part of taking CPSC 310, my university's software
                      engineering course, I was assigned to work on this web
                      development project with a partner for the entire
                      semester. The goal was to create an application that
                      allows the user to analyze zip-file data on UBC courses
                      and rooms by using a custom query language. Both the
                      project specification and the tech stack were
                      predetermined by the course staff, which meant that we had
                      to teach ourselves how to use new languages and frameworks
                      to create a complicated product. The amount of provided
                      starter code was minimal - my partner and I were
                      responsible for designing, implementing and testing a
                      solution that fulfilled the project requirements. Each
                      sprint emphasized a particular aspect of software
                      development such as unit testing, server-side asynchronous
                      logic and frontend data validation. Here's a detailed
                      breakdown of the project:

                    <p>
                      <strong>Sprint 0:</strong> Following the principles of
                      test-driven development, I reinforced my understanding of
                      the project specification by writing a set of over 60
                      black-box unit tests for functionality that was yet to be
                      implemented. These tests checked that our application
                      appropriately handled the adding/removal of datasets and
                      also verified that correct data output was returned when
                      running a variety of queries. Since no sample solution was
                      provided for any part of the project, this test suite was
                      the only means of validating my work, apart from
                      submitting directly to the autograder and risking a grade
                      deduction if any regression tests failed. Trying to
                      achieve a comprehensive yet parsimonious test suite forced
                      me to not only think carefully about the program's
                      expected behaviour for all possible inputs, but also
                      ensure that my test data were actually representative of
                      the use cases implied in the project specification.

                      <strong>Sprint 1:</strong> This sprint was all about
                      backend development, which was roughly split into two
                      parts. In the first part, my partner and I developed a
                      mechanism for loading UBC course data from an input zip
                      file to the local disk. The second part's objective was to
                      implement the parsing and interpretation of a given custom
                      query language that allows the user to examine the course
                      data on disk (eg. find all past Sociology course offerings
                      that had an enrollment of more than 100 students). This
                      sprint was a great exercise in asynchronous Javascript - I
                      quickly became used to working with promises and callbacks
                      because of the large amount of file I/O involved in this
                      sprint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Sprint 2:</strong> This sprint extended our code
                      from Sprint 1 to incorporate more complicated
                      functionality. Our backend now had to be adapted to
                      support querying for data related to <em>rooms</em> at
                      UBC. Besides having to alter our disk's data model to
                      support the loading of room data from a zip file, we also
                      had to upgrade our query logic to support aggregation: the
                      user should be able to ask questions relating to groups of
                      courses or rooms (ex. find the average number of seats
                      across all classrooms in the UBC Chemistry building). A
                      lot of the work involved in this sprint consisted of
                      modifying existing code to generalize its purpose. This
                      process taught us a lot of valuable lessons regarding how
                      to write code that was readable, maintainable and
                      extensible to change. I found <em>abstraction</em> to be
                      absolutely key to this - by taking advantage of the
                      programming constructs built into Javascript such as
                      objects and higher-order functions, we were able to
                      greatly reduce the length of our code while making it less
                      error-prone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <strong>Sprint 3:</strong> In this sprint, the focus
                      shifted to the frontend of our application. We were
                      responsible for constructing the appropriate query based
                      on the user's response to an extended HTML form that
                      contained various checklists, buttons and text boxes. The
                      form could thus generate many possible kinds of
                      submissions corresponding to both invalid and valid
                      queries. Consequently, we had to be very careful with the
                      logic of our code - it was often easy to label a valid
                      submission as invalid, or vice-versa. Proper testing was
                      crucial for assuring ourselves of both the code's
                      correctness and our own sanities. Finally, we used Express
                      to configure basic HTTP methods (ex. GET, POST, DELETE)
                      for the frontend to access all of our server's
                      functionality, ie. adding/removing datasets and performing
                      queries.
