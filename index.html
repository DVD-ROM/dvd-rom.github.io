              I'm a senior-year student at the
              <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>,
              where I've spent many years changing paths. I initially majored in
              biology, switched to mathematics, and then finally settled on
              computer science - a diverse field of study with a wonderful blend
              of theory and applications. I was completely fascinated by the
              theoretical side of things during the first half of my degree, but
              the ideas eventually started to become too abstract for my tastes.
              Then a major turning point in my interests came during the
              2020-2021 academic year, which was a new experience in multiple
              ways. School was moved entirely online due to the COVID-19
              pandemic, and my coursework placed a heavy emphasis on large team
              programming projects instead of conventional exams.
            </p>

            <p>
              Despite However, the most valuable experience in my project-based
              courses ultimately wasn't learning about how to use specific
              technologies - instead, it was having the opportunity to work as
              part of a team. The most important skill I practiced that year,
              has become one of my favourite aspects of programming, which
              ultimately convinced me that These experiences reinforced my love
              for programming, and The most important thing was the ability to
              work with other people, and manage the relationships. I had
              experience being the most knowledgable person on my team and also
              the person dragging everything down. I learned to work with other
              people - the feeling of struggling through a bug or design issue
              with other people, learning to listen to others, and succeeding
              together is something that you live for. conversely, struggling t
              hrough conflict, enduring failure toghether, is an invaluable
              lesson that this is what life looks like - being with other people
              I've done a lot of growing. I realized that as beautiful theory
              may be, this is the sort of stuff that gets you up in the morning
              - the prospect of a new project and being part of your team.

            <p>
              In contrast to my previous experience with theoretical courses,
              which emphasized a traditional combination of notetaking and test
              practice, I spent that year mainly going through the following
              process:
            </p>

            <p class="body-text">
              Although I already learned how to program using basic data
              structures and algorithms in previous CS courses, it wasn't until
              the 2020-2021 academic year that I truly started to get a sense of
              all the joys and complexities of
              <em>software engineering</em>. My education that year really could
              be described as "learning by building things". This was the idea
              that the best way to understand a new concept was to apply it to a
              project. In doing so, having to think about things like edge
              cases, error handling and performance optimizations naturally led
              to a deeper understanding that I would never have been able to
              achieve just by reading notes. Over the course of that year, I
              transitioned from being knowing little of web development to being
              able to appreciate the details of things like asynchronous
              Javascript, SQL query optimization and the TCP protocol - simply
              because understanding these details were crucial for my projects
              to work. This active style of learning appealed to me more than
              anything I had ever done before, and quickly became one of my
              favourite aspects of programming.

              both challenged and rewarded me in ways I had never felt before.
              Some of my best memories from university, slogging through
              challenges together triumphing, and also some of my most
              challenging tests. was therefore done through a paradigm
              completely new to me, one that was completely different to a
              traditional paradigm. in an entirely new paradigm of learning I
              came into that year accustomed to a pattern of listening to
              lectures, reading notes and attempting practice problems. In
              contrast, Whereas achieving success in previous coursework usually
              meant reading notes carefully and doing practice problems, I was
              previously used to reading notes and attempting practice problems
              in my previous studies, my learning that year
